Hi! 

I am a first-year PhD student at MIT, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://people.csail.mit.edu/indyk/'>Piotr Indyk</a>. Before that, I was an undergrad at CMU.

My interest is theoretical computer science. Currently, I'm particularly interested in algorithms for massive or high-dimensional data.
