Hi! 

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at <a href='https://www.cs.cmu.edu/'>School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University</a>. I majored in computer science, with a concentration in <a href='http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/scsconcentrations/#algorithmsandcomplexitytextcontainer'>Algorithms and Complexity Theory</a>. My expected graduation date is December 2023.

My academic interests is theoretical computer science in general. Currently, I am spending most of my time learning new mathematical and algorithmic topics to gain a better understanding of the field. For more details, please check out my [research](/research) page.
