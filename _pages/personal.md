- My hair color oscillates between blue and green.

- During my spare time, I enjoy musesums in a causual way (please visit Carnegie Museum of Art & Natural History if you are in Pittsburgh and haven't already!!)

- Just like many of my fellow cmu students, I maintain a list of reviews for the courses that I have taken in cmu. However, while writing my reviews, I found them inevitably become very subjective (and potentially biased), so I decided to hide them [here](/courses).
